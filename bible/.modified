ðŸŽ¨ Floating Pills Design Description
Visual Style:
"Create floating pill-shaped UI elements with a glass-morphism effect. Each pill should have:
Semi-transparent background (80% opacity white/dark)
Backdrop blur filter for frosted glass appearance
Subtle border with low opacity
Rounded-full shape (fully rounded corners)
Drop shadow for floating elevation effect"
Technical Implementation:
"Use these CSS classes for the glass-morphism pills:
bg-white/80 dark:bg-neutral-800/60 (semi-transparent background)
backdrop-blur-lg (frosted glass blur effect)
border border-slate-300/70 dark:border-neutral-700/50 (subtle borders)
rounded-full (pill shape)
shadow-xl (floating shadow)
px-4 py-2 (internal padding)"
Layout Pattern:
"Position floating pills using absolute positioning without container backgrounds:
Left pill: absolute top-14 left-4
Center pill: absolute top-14 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2
Right pill: absolute top-14 right-4
All pills at same vertical level with consistent spacing"
Interactive States:
"Add hover effects with:
hover:bg-white/90 dark:hover:bg-neutral-800/80 (slight opacity increase)
transition-all duration-200 (smooth transitions)
Scale animations: whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }} and whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}"
